# MiniTla
MiniTla is a complete example of a simple Discord bot in JavaScript. It can help you to get started with creating a bot using the Discord.js library.

## Self Host
> Before you start, you will need to get a bot account [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). Copy the bot token as you will need it later on.
>
> You also need to get Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The setup for this bot is pretty simple. 
### Steps:
1. Create a new folder for the bot, and open command prompt.
1. CD to the folder. For example: `cd C:/Users/username/Desktop`.
1. Run the following commands
```
npm -init -y
npm install discord.js
git clone https://github.com/tlanotyt/MiniTla
```
Note: If you do not already have Git installed, either download it, or clone it from GitHub directly.
1. Edit the variables in `config.json`.
1. Run `node bot.js`.

The bot should be ready now.
